      "text: \"<question>Scrape the list of highest grossing films from Wikipedia. It is at the URL:\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films\\n\\nAnswer the following questions and respond with a JSON array of strings containing the answer.\\n\\n1. How many $2 bn movies were released before 2000?\\n2. Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?\\n3. What\\'s the correlation between the Rank and Peak?\\n4. Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak along with a dotted red regression line through it.\\n   Return as a base-64 encoded data URI, `\\\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...\\\"` under 100,000 bytes.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS:\\n1. From product_image.png, extract product name.\\n2. Look up this product in product_catalog.db and return full details.\\n3. From the Wikipedia URL, return the top 3 best-selling books.\\n\\nUSER_PROMPT = f\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nYou are generating Python code that solves the given problem in multiple incremental steps.\\n\\nRules:\\n- You can read {folder}/metadata.txt if it exists.And pass its info to you llm call.\\n- Store any new insights into {folder}/metadata.txt (append).\\n- After each partial step, raise StepIncompleteError to continue the loop.\\n- Only store the final answer in {folder}/result.txt.\\n\\n- External libraries must be listed; built-ins should not be listed.\\n- If an error occurs, raise StepIncompleteError so the controlling loop can retry or continue.\\n- Use the provided Gemini API key when additional reasoning or code generation is needed mid-process.\\n\\nYour process:\\n1. Read any available metadata from metadata.txt.\\n2. Execute one logical step toward the solution.\\n3. Save findings to metadata.txt.\\n4. Raise StepIncompleteError until the final step is reached.\\n5. On the last step, store the result in result.txt and set is_correct = true.\\n\\nThis task will be run without human interaction; your code must handle data retrieval, LLM calls, and file operations automatically.\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n\\nfor image processing use python and don\\'t use gemini vision model it is not working\\n- Always return valid JSON:\\n  {{\\n      \\\"code\\\": \\\"<python_code_here>\\\",\\n      \\\"libraries\\\": [\\\"list\\\", \\\"of\\\", \\\"external_libraries\\\"],\\n      \\\"is_correct\\\": true_or_false\\n  }}\\n</question>\\nI know nothing about data analytics. To solve my question, follow this exact process:\\n\\n### Step 1:\\nI will give you a question statement with possible data sources (URL, CSV, database, etc.).  \\nYour first task: generate code that extracts **basic info** about the data source:\\n- URL \u2192 Scrape and summarize tables, headings, and important structures. Keep summary under 100 tokens.\\n- CSV/Excel \u2192 Return first 3 rows.\\n- Database \u2192 Show table names or schema preview.\\n- PDF/Text/Image \u2192 Extract a small preview (not full content).\\n\\n### Step 2:\\nDownload or extract the required data and save it in uploads/52bd1d13-7919-43c2-bcc0-fa1bcc8ee048.\\n\\n### Step 3:\\nI will pass you the collected info from uploads/52bd1d13-7919-43c2-bcc0-fa1bcc8ee048/metadata.txt.  \\nThen, generate code to solve the question fully and save the **final answer** in uploads/52bd1d13-7919-43c2-bcc0-fa1bcc8ee048/result.txt (or result.json if the format is structured).\\n\\n### Step 4:\\nI will give you the content of uploads/52bd1d13-7919-43c2-bcc0-fa1bcc8ee048/result.txt.  \\n- If correct \u2192 mark `run_this=0`.  \\n- If wrong \u2192 provide corrected code to recompute the answer.  \\n\\n### Error Handling:\\nIf I give you an error message:\\n- Fix the exact issue and return corrected code.\\n- If the error repeats, generate entirely new code.\\n\\n### Output Format:\\nYou must always answer in **valid JSON** like this:\\n{\\n    \\\"code\\\": \\\"<python_code_here>\\\",\\n    \\\"libraries\\\": [\\\"list\\\", \\\"of\\\", \\\"external_libraries\\\"],\\n    \\\"run_this\\\": 1 or 0\\n}\\n\\n### Additional Rules:\\n- Save extracted info into uploads/52bd1d13-7919-43c2-bcc0-fa1bcc8ee048/metadata.txt (append mode).  \\n- Save final answers in uploads/52bd1d13-7919-43c2-bcc0-fa1bcc8ee048/result.txt (or uploads/52bd1d13-7919-43c2-bcc0-fa1bcc8ee048/result.json if structured).  \\n- Always prepend file access with uploads/52bd1d13-7919-43c2-bcc0-fa1bcc8ee048/filename.  \\n- Use only necessary pip-installable external libraries.  \\n\\nExample Output: if asked to send a JSON like this:\\n[\\\"What is the meadian of data\\\", \\\"What is mean\\\", \\\"provide base64 image\\\"]\\n\\nThen, send result like this:\\n\\n[20, 25, \\\"base64 image  url here\\\"]\\nI mean don\\'t send answers like key:answer, unless it is specified.\\n\"\n"
